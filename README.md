# To-do : The client way 

This app is a playful command-line tool designed to simplify  your to-do list management (yeah believe me ), right from your terminal. Built with Node.js and powered by the Commander.js library, this project offers a range of functionalities:

    Add tasks to your list.
    Delete tasks when they're no longer needed.
    Update tasks to keep them relevant.
    Toggle task completion status.
    Clean the entire list when starting fresh.
    Display all tasks in a neat, JSON-stored format.
    (quite a range of tasks, lmao)
